# OIBSIP-Data-Science-Internship

## Description
Welcome to the Oasis Infobyte Internship Project repository! This project is part of my one month internship journey with Oasis Infobyte, where I had the opportunity to work on various data science and machine learning tasks.

## Overview
During the internship, I worked on several real-world projects that allowed me to apply my knowledge of data science concepts and techniques to solve practical problems. From building predictive models to analyzing large datasets, each project provided valuable learning experiences and insights into the field of data science.

## Tasks
- **Project 1: Iris Flower Classification**
  - Description: Built a classification model to predict the species of iris flowers based on their characteristics.
  - Technologies Used: Python, scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook.

- **Project 2: Car Price Prediction**
  - Description: Developed a machine learning model to predict the selling price of used cars based on various features.
  - Technologies Used: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook.

- **Project 3: Email Spam Detection**
  - Description: Implemented an email spam detector using machine learning techniques to classify emails as spam or non-spam.
  - Technologies Used: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook.
